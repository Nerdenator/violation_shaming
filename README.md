# violation_shaming
A site to list the top code violators in Kansas City, Missouri

# notes
For data take a look at Property Violations under Reported Issues on  https://github.com/codeforkansascity/kc-open-data-library/wiki  You should be able to go to that link and generate an initial report, Address or KIVA.  But that does not give you the name of the owner, Parcel Data https://data.kcmo.org/dataset/Parcel-Data/vrys-qgrz allows you to look that up.  Does this give you a start?  Also if you find interesting data please add it to the first link.

# Questions to answer
* How many violations are on properties owned by residents of the states of Missouri and Kansas?

* How many violations are on properties owned by residents of countries other than the US?
* How many violations are on properties owned by owners with multiple properties?
